# Project Overview

This project it a part of [Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree Program](https://udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) and it focuses on testing javascript code using [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) framework for a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. 

## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.


## Tests performed on this project

#### RSS Feeds

* are defined
* each feed has a URL defined and that URL is non empty
* each feed has a name defined and that name is not empty
* each feed has a valid URL

#### The menu

* is hidden by default
* it does display when clicked
* it does hide when clicked again

#### Initial Entries

* when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container

#### New Feed Selection

* when a new feed is loaded, the content actually changes
